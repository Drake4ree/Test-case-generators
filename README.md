# Test-case-generators
This repository contains codes for generating some random test cases which can be used for genrating test cases for coding competitions, testing efficiency of your algorithms etc.

All the test case generators are written in C++. The codes are fully commented for easy usage of the codes. Also a readme file describing the code and the tweaking you could do with the code is given algonside.

All the test case generators also have a checker implemented inside them which checks whether all the test case data generated is according to the constraints you set above in the code or not. In case of any wrong generation of data, it simply throws and "SIGABRT" error. If you encounter this while using any of these files, do report the error (and preferably screenshot) so that the code can be updated for further use.
