#Usage Details

###Variable used
1. lim_n 				= 		maximum size of array desired
2. range_low_first 		= 		lower limit of first part of numbers
3. range_high_first		= 		higher limit of first part of numbers
4. range_low_second		= 		lower limit of second part of numbers
5. range_high_second	= 		higher limit of second part of numbers

###Lines to be modified
* If you do not want the number of test cases in file, comment line number 37
* If you do not want the size of array to be displayed, comment line number 44
* To set the number of test cases for the file, set the variable "test_cases" to desired value on line number 35
* To change the limit on mamimum size of array, change variable "lim_n" on line number 8
* To make the size of the array a fixed value, set variable "n" to the value desired on line number 39
* To change the lowest value of first part of numbers, change variable "range_low_first" on line number 48
* To change the highest value of first part of numbers, change variable "range_high_first" on line number 49
* To change the lowest value of second part of numbers, change variable "range_low_second" on line number 50
* To change the highest value of second part of numbers, change variable "range_high_second" on line number 51


###Output file name
By default it is set to "inp.txt".

To change it you can change the name of file on line number 28.

###Success of Execution
After building the program, if no assertion errors are shown on your screen, file will be generated successfully, provided you put reasonable limits on some variables. For example, maximum array size should be around 10^6 at max.

If any assertion failed errors were seen on your screen while generating the output, do report the error with the screenshot on the Issues Tab. I will try to update the code then.
