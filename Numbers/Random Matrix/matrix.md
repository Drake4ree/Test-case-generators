#Usage Details

###Variable used
1. lim_n 		= 		maximum size of row of matrix desired
2. lim_m		= 		maximum size of column of matrix desired
3. range_low 	= 		lower limit of numbers
4. range_high	= 		higher limit of numbers

###Lines to be modified
* If you do not want the number of test cases in file, comment line number 37
* If you do not want the dimensions of matrix to be displayed, comment line number 46
* To set the number of test cases for the file, set the variable "test_cases" to desired value on line number 35
* To change the limit on mamimum size of row of array, change variable "lim_n" on line number 8
* To change the limit on mamimum size of column of array, change variable "lim_n" on line number 9
* To make the size of the array a fixed value, set variables "n" and "m" to the value desired on line number 42 and 44
* To change the lowest value of numbers, change variable "range_low" on line number 50
* To change the highest value of numbers, change variable "range_high" on line number 51


###Output file name
By default it is set to "inp.txt".

To change it you can change the name of file on line number 28.

###Success of Execution
After building the program, if no assertion errors are shown on your screen, file will be generated successfully, provided you put reasonable limits on some variables. For example, maximum array size should be around 10^6 at max.

If any assertion failed errors were seen on your screen while generating the output, do report the error with the screenshot on the Issues Tab. I will try to update the code then.
