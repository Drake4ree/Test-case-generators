#Usage Details

###Variable used
1. lim_n 		= 		maximum size of string desired

###Lines to be modified
* If you do not want the number of test cases in file, comment line number 31
* If you do not want the size of array to be displayed, comment line number 38
* To set the number of test cases for the file, set the variable "test_cases" to desired value on line number 29
* To change the limit on mamimum size of string, change variable "lim_n" on line number 8
* To make the size of the string a fixed value, set variable "n" to the value desired on line number 36
* To set what characters the string should contain, set the string "user" to the desired characters. Make sure about the characters formating and escape sequences.


###Output file name
By default it is set to "inp.txt".

To change it you can change the name of file on line number 28.

###Success of Execution
After building the program, if no assertion errors are shown on your screen, file will be generated successfully, provided you put reasonable limits on some variables. For example, maximum array size should be around 10^6 at max.

If any assertion failed errors were seen on your screen while generating the output, do report the error with the screenshot on the Issues Tab. I will try to update the code then.
